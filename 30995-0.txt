                                  NOTES


The following hymns are in the Chill-way-uk dialect of the language of
the Alkomaylum nation of Indians, who live along the Fraser River, from
Yale to the Coast, and on Vancouver Island, at Cowichan and Nanaimo. The
Alkomaylum, (or Ankomeenum, sometimes called Stawlo or River language,)
as spoken by the Cowichans, is sweet and rythmical. The Chillwayuk
dialect is harsher and more guttural. The Nanaimos, the Yales, the Sumas,
the Kwantuls, etc. of B.C., and the Nooksaks of Wash., U.S.A., each speak
a slightly different dialect of the same language.




                           ==> PRONUNCIATION.


_`_ When before k, sound the letter by pressing the back of the tongue
against the soft palate, and expelling the letter with a clicking sound.
When before t, ts, or tz, press the tip of the tongue against the hard
palate, and expel the sound as before.

_kh_, Is sounded by lightly pressing the back of the tongue against the
soft palate, and emitting the sound in a slurring manner.

_tl_, and _lth_, Are sounded by pressing the tip of the tongue against
the hard palate and emit as in kh.

_a_, Is pronounced ah; while all others are regular as in English.


T.C., C.M.T., and W.H.B., at the end of each hymn, are the initials of
the translators.

                          THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.


1 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

2 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to
them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them
that love me, and keep my commandments.

3 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord
will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

4 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor
and do all thy work: but the seventh is the sabbath of the Lord thy God:
in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger
that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

5 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

6 Thou shalt not kill.

7 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

8 Thou shalt not steal.

9 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
